# Leffell High Altitude Balloon Main Arduino Code

This project is currently in the process of being assembled. Other code from other components can be found eleswhere in the [Leffell-Space](https://github.com/orgs/Leffell-Space/repositories) organization and we are in the process of adding code from those separate repositories to this one. This is will be the final code that gets launched.

## Features

- Collects temperature, humidity, and pressure data
- Tracks balloon location using GPS
- Transmits data wirelessly to a ground station
