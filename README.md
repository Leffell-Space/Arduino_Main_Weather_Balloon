# Leffell High Altitude Balloon Main Arduino Code

This Arduino project is designed to collect and transmit weather data from a weather balloon. It includes sensors for temperature, humidity, pressure, and GPS to track the balloon's location.

## Features

- Collects temperature, humidity, and pressure data
- Tracks balloon location using GPS
- Transmits data wirelessly to a ground station

## Components

- Arduino board
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity sensor
- Pressure sensor
- GPS module
- Wireless transmitter
- Power supply (battery)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leffell-Space/Arduino_Main_Weather_Balloon.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the necessary libraries (if any).
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power on the Arduino and sensors.
2. Launch the weather balloon.
3. Monitor the data transmitted to the ground station.
